# NUIG-CAR-NetSim

This repo contains a poor attempt at creating a V2X network simulation for the CAR Group at University of Galway. The intent was to use the SUMO mobility simulator to generate mobility traces, which then fed into NS-3 for network simulation. 

NS-3 was chosen due to it's ability to connect to the outsite world if needed, given that a significant amount of the research completed in the CAR Group surround sensors and deep learning performance.
